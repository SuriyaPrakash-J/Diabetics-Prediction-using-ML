# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is focused on predicting whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on various health indicators. Using data science techniques and supervised machine learning models, we analyze and build a predictive system based on real-world health data.

# 🧾 Dataset Information

The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database, which contains medical records for 768 female patients of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 and above.


# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python – Programming Language
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – Numerical computing
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

# ⚙️ Project Workflow

Importing Libraries and Dataset
Load essential libraries and the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical summaries of the data.
Missing value analysis.
Visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, pair plots).

# Data Preprocessing

Handle missing or zero values in columns like Glucose, BMI, Insulin.
Normalize or scale features if necessary.
Train-test split (typically 70-30 or 80-20).
Model Building Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented:


# 📈 Model Evaluation

Each model is trained and tested on the dataset. The results are compared using the following metrics:
Accuracy – How often is the classifier correct?
Precision – What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?
Recall – What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?
F1 Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall

# ✅ Results (Model Performance Summary)

Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 77.92%
Precision: 0.76
Recall: 0.74
F1-Score: 0.75
